          During the last two years of my college time, I rented a small
          furnished apartment near my university to do my work more
          conveniently. Later my girlfriend moved in, cooking and living
          together. Since then, I was thinking neither the hotels nor long-term
          leasing apartment can satisfy young college students' needs â€” they
          were too expensive. This is the story of a living project for young
          couples in big cities, like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou.
