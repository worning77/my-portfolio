    After graduation, I start to help my fatherâ€™s business,{" "}
    <High>a cement distributor for highways</High>. Before, they did everything
    manually, such as checking orders, which took a lot of time. In order to
    improve the work efficiency, I designed a scanner. Although it is not 100%
    accurate, the accuracy can be greatly improved shortly. I am still working
    on this project.
