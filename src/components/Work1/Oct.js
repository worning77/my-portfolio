        But during the design progress, we found it was{" "}
        <High>hard to create topics and subtopics easily</High>. Even though we
        could make several examples and user storyboards when we introduced our
        idea to others, still we canâ€™t make an all-round topic tree. We found
        that we need a better way to help the future users understand how to use
        this platform.

          In order to attract future users, we knew we should create a sense of
          cool and <High>high-quality content pool.</High> And considering there
          was no Instafamous in China, what we had in university is the group of
          people:<br />
          <High>The most popular professors and leaders of student clubs.</High>
          <br /> So, we decided to interview some of those teachers, preparing
          some related questions. In this way, future students would be
          attracted to our platform by watching these videos.{" "}

        <Ctext>
          Among 15 professors from all kinds of fields, including psychology,
          finance, computer science, sociology, who we had face-to-face
          conversations, we got these:<br />
          <br />
          <li>12 of them liked our idea</li>
          <br />
          <li>5 of them cannot be interviewed because of time-conflict</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            2 of them didn't want to be interviewed because they thought it
            might be bad for their reputation
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            3 of them suggested that we'd better{" "}
