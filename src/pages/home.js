          text="I have always been aspiring to be both a visionary artist and a risk-taking entrepreneur. Majoring in mathematics in my undergraduate study laid a solid foundation for me to think logistically. The process of brainstorming ideas and visualizing them pushes me to learn and practice coding languages. My experiences of starting up a company and attempting to launch a product give me an entrepreneurial mindset. Knowing that graduate schools offering innovation education can further help me become a professional product designer with entrepreneurial spirit, Iâ€™m currently applying for programs such as Human Computer Interaction, in the graduate level."
